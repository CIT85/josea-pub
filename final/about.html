    <h3>What inspired me to make this?</h3>
    <p> I was inspired by looking at posts about serene views of different landscapes on social media platforms, especially on TikTok! (I've also seen city landscapes, not just natural ones.)</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p> I may or may not add more information to most of the files. But I am thinking about adding smooth scrolling behavior to all html files sooner or later. I could keep the local version of this repository and maybe add JavaScript for enhanced interactivity (I'll do that once I've learned how to use that coding language).</p>
