# Chosen topic: Landscapes
Why: I chose this one because it's one of the good options I could go with. But also because I want to show some nice views from images. I'm gonna be relying on looking for images instead of creating them.

# Pages
<ul>
<li>Main(1st Page): Mountains</li>
<li>2nd Page: Deserts</li>
<li>3rd Page: Bodies of Water</li>
<li>4th Page: Cold Areas</li>
<li>5th Page: Forests</li>
</ul>

## Typography Enhancements
Links: for each pseudo link class, I made them change color and change font weight when hovered.
Headings: Gave them color and changed their font weight. Also giving them borders and padding/margin spacing between other contents.

## Decorative or Positional Enhancements
Page Nav: Set its position to fixed. Added coloring and Font weight. Made it only appear when hovering over them, So they won't obscure any content when trying to look at the main content.
Footer and Header: Set their positions to fixed to make them more accessible. This also makes the footer easy to access without having to scroll all the way down.

# Note:
For the style sheets made for each page, Most of the stuff will be the same as each other but they will have some different adjustments like color. (Disclaimer: I'm not gonna do it because I would give myself too much work on making the palette in the site page.)

## Phase 3 Overview 
I have used flexbox for the header, Page navigation sidebar and section navigation links. I have also used that for the footer. Page navigation sidebar is set to the left in the home page and for the other pages to the right (applies to other pages). Flexbox was used to make the header and footer stay in the viewport and their respective edges of it.

I have used grid for the introduction on each page. (Slightly different from in site page and about page.) Name of introduction is the column, And the main text is the row. Name goes above text and text are below them.

## New Subpage
The purpose of the new subpage I created Is to serve as an About Me page. It contains a paragraph about who I am and what I do for a living. It also has an image of me to show what I look like. Lastly, it has a section of (currently) two options, Which is to download the favicon that the website uses. The second option directs the user to email me.

## Image Optimizations
I have made optimizations on images by making them adapt to viewport size. I have also rounded their edges with border-radius.

## Accessibility 
The images would change size when a screen meets a certain aspect ratio. This is done through media queries.

## Hero Image Design
I've chosen the image of earth's stratosphere because i thought that it might fit the topic of the site. But I did also thought of looking for other images but that was the only option for now. It is located in the contact page. I put it on the top of the page, rounded the edges, added a pfp of myself and made the background image slightly faded.

## Note to self
Use padding bottom and padding top as alternatives to using line breaks. For example, if content are underneath the header, use padding top to move stuff below it instead of using multiple line breaks.
